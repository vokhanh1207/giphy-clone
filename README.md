# How long did you spend on the coding test? 
- ~24 - 28 hours.
# What would you add to your solution if you had more time? 
- Put reusable components into another folder (project), export them as modules, and inport back to this project. This project just has only components which preresent pages.
- Optimize performance when the user srolls down so far.
- More animation.
- More testcases.
# If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
oh, a lot... but I also added many...
